            <dd>Greedy algorithm method is one of the strategy like Divide and Conquer which is used to solve 
                the problems. It is used for solving <mark>Optimization problem</mark>.<br>
            An optimization problem is a problem is a problem that demands either maximum or minimum choice.<br>
        It is an straight forward approach. </dd>

            <dd>The main function of this approach is that decision is taken on the basis of <u>current available information</u>.
                Whatever the current information is present , the desicion is made without worrying about the effect of current decision in future.
